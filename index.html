	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>My name is Devon Crossin and I am a senior at the Perk School. I have been coming to this school since freshman year. Currently I'm a day student and live 10 minutes off of campus. I love to play baseball and video games. My goal for college is to major in Computer Risk Analysis and Security, like how my brother did. I hope to have built a desktop computer by the end of the summer. I will be applying to Penn State Harrisburg and will, if accepted, be playing baseball there.</p>
